# TezsterGUI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

Tezster-GUI comes with pretty much the same functionalities as CLI but in its beta version, it comes integrated with the CLI. After starting tezos node on your local machine with Tezster-CLI, you can clone it from here.

You will need angular-cli installed on the machine. A brief process to do so is mentioned below:

```
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```

cd into the cloned repo as:

```
cd /(path to folder)/Tezster-GUI
```
Then open the GUI with these commands
```
sudo npm install
```
```
ng serveâ€Š--open
```
